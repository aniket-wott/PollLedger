> A beginner-friendly decentralized polling system built with Solidity.

---

## 📘 Project Description

**PollLedger** is a simple Ethereum smart contract designed to demonstrate how blockchain can be used for fair and transparent voting.  
It allows users to vote for predefined candidates without any external setup or constructor arguments.

This project is great for beginners learning **Solidity**, **Remix IDE**, and the fundamentals of **decentralized applications (dApps)**.
